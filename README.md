# Flight-delay-Analysis

The problems statement that are tried to solve in this project:

List of Questions planned to be investigated:
i. How many flights were there for each day of the week?
ii. How many of the tail codes are not listed?
iii. Which week had the highest proportion of flights that were late? Is this result significant?
iv. Which day of the week is best for minimizing departure delays for customers?
v. Which time of day is best for minimizing departure delay?
vi. Which is the best day of the week to fly?
vii. Which is the best day of the month to fly?
viii. Which combination of arrival and departure airports is associated with the minimum and maximum delays?
ix. How much do weather delays contribute to arrival delay?
x. What are the variables that contribute to arrival delays?

Goals of the project:
* To clean, process and analyze the flight departure and delay data obtained from airports in United States.
* To analyze various types of delay, time of delay and visualize the same.
* To ask logical questions and then obtain answers for the same by using various functions in R.
* Support the above answers by providing visualizations.
* Finally, to help passenger better decide on which is the best day, time and airports to travel.
